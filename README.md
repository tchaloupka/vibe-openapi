# vibe-openapi

This is a WIP library to add [OpenApi](https://swagger.io/specification) support to vibe-d.

It supports version [3.0.2](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.2.md) of the OpenApi specification.

Main focus ATM is generation of the OpenApi documentation from the REST API interface registered in vibe-d server.
